The view command allows you to view a manifest in the CLI before executing the install command. This way, you can review the configuration and steps included in the manifest before applying it to your system.

```bash
cfs view <MANIFEST_URL>
```

## Example

```bash
cfs view https://someinstallhost/installme.yml
```
