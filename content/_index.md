# Introduction to ConfigSet and cfs

ConfigSet is a platform that aims to simplify infrastructure automation by providing users with a centralized repository of pre-made `cfs` manifests for various tasks. These manifests are designed to help users automate their infrastructure setup and management in a consistent and reliable manner.

`cfs`, or Config File System, is an open-source configuration management tool that facilitates the management, automation, and deployment of infrastructure. It enables users to describe their infrastructure needs using simple, easy-to-understand manifest files. These files define the actions, components, and configurations required for a specific task.
